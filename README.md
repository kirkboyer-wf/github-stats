Github Stats
---------------------------------------------------
Github Stats provides statistics for an organization's users based on
mentions of them in the organization's pull-request and issue comments.

In the future, it may do more complicated analyses (possibly some akin to
PageRank, replacing pages with users and hyperlinks with mentions).

Using Github Stats
---------------------------------------------------
For now, the only thing you can do is get a report. Go to 
githubstats.appspot.com/report to download a text file containing the report.
